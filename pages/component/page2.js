                    In this article, we will use Next.js to build a static blog framework with the design and structure
                    inspired by Jekyll. Iâ€™ve always been a big fan of how Jekyll makes it easier for beginners to setup a

                    the advanced users.

                    With the introduction of Next.js in recent years, combined with the popularity of React, there is a new
                    avenue to explore for static blogs. Next.js makes it super easy to build static websites based on the file
                    system itself with little to no configuration required
